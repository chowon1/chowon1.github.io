            <h3>
                Director’s note
            </h3>
            <p>
                I first read the award-winning “Hateshinaki Kawaki” by Akio Fukamachi
                without considering a film adaptation. The story appeared to me like a
                Greek myth, and stayed in my mind for a long time. <br><br>
                Love and hate do not sit on opposite sides of a table. This sentiment, that I felt
                particularly strongly when I was shooting my last film “Confessions,” became
                the theme of my next project, and then I realized I could use the story of this
                novel to depict these emotions, ‘love’ and ‘enmity’, interacting with each
                other through the relationship between a father and a daughter. <br><br>
                I also became fascinated with the main character, Fujishima. He is full of
                flaws and completely messed up, but he can’t help but yearn for human
                connection. The problem is that he can only communicate with others
                through violence. As soon as he connects with someone, he first harms, then
                destroys and thus loses the person. I wanted to make a movie about this
                man. I wanted to portray a good-for-nothing man becoming a father. <br><br> The
                loneliness of a man with this kind of nature is not only tragic, but also comic.
                In “The World of Kanako,” I tried to make a film full of wild energy, in contrast
                to “Confessions,” and asked for baroque and complex performances from
                the cast. I wanted the audience to grasp the incomprehensible human power
                radiating from them. I hope you enjoy the story of love and hate between the
                bastard father Fujishima and the devilish daughter Kanako.
